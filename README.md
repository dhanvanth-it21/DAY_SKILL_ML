to pull

git pull https://github.com/dhanvanth-it21/DAY_SKILL_ML


git pull: 
      Update your local working branch with commits from the remote, and update all remote tracking branches.
git pull --rebase: 
      Update your local working branch with commits from the remote, but rewrite history so any local commits occur after all new commits coming from the remote,           avoiding a merge commit.
git pull --force: 
      This option allows you to force a fetch of a specific remote tracking branch when using the <refspec> option that would otherwise not be fetched due to               conflicts. To force Git to overwrite your current branch to match the remote tracking branch, read below about using git reset.
git pull --all: 
      Fetch all remotes - this is handy if you are working on a fork or in another use case with multiple remotes.
